      "You were the shadow to my light Did you feel us? Another star You fade away Afraid our aim is out of sight    Wanna see us Alight  Where are you now? Where are you now? Where are you now? Was it all in my fantasy? Where are you now? Were you only imaginary?  Where are you now?    Atlantis Under the sea Under the sea Where are you now? Another dream The monster's running wild inside of me I'm faded I'm faded So lost, I'm faded I'm faded    So lost, I'm faded  These shallow waters never met what I needed I'm letting go a deeper dive Eternal silence of the sea. I'm breathing alive  Where are you now? Where are you now? Under the bright but faded lights You've set my heart on fire Where are you now? Where are you now?     Where are you now? Atlantis Under the sea Under the sea Where are you now? Another dream The monster's running wild inside of me I'm faded I'm faded So lost, I'm faded I'm faded So lost, I'm faded",

      "Yeah Let me take you back to when I was starting out on the come up I was grinding 'til the sun up, my neighbors told me to shut up But they couldn't see the bigger vision got no intuition Now my taxes more than their tuition, they see how I'm living And my idols becoming my competition today I remember I was making under minimum wage It was part of the story, but now I'm turning the page And I got bars for days but can't be locked in the cage I been underrated overlooked like a speed limit They been tryna slow me down like I got a speeding ticket I got demons I keep hidden in the back of my head I'm not vegan, I keep feeding off the shit that they said I been living out my dreams while they stuck in they bed I be thinking like a king till the day that I'm dead I remember when they never would've listened to me And now I'm everything that they ever been wishing to be I been working overtime like every day of the week I been studying in school, already got a degree Tryna make it to a doctor, I've been working on my patience I'm tryna make a living with multiple occupations Coming outta the basement onto radio stations I'm going face to face with all of my contemplations I feel like God's gift and this is my celebration I'm tryna lead the way for all the future generations   [Chorus] I don't want 'em calling on my phone (on my phone) I been on my way to the top, no ceiling They leaving a message at the tone (at the tone) Tryna get involved, but I really don't need 'em I don't want 'em calling on my line (on my line) I know what they wanted and it's not no secret I'ma tell 'em that I'm doing fine (doing fine) Tryna get involved, but I really don't need 'em  [Verse 2] Yeah I got old friends slowly turning into enemies I got people in my life tryna block my energy And I'm tryna keep my focus surrounded by Hennessy People drinking every night, tryna fade their memories I been working out my mind, staying focused mentally I been watering my grass, tryna grow my money tree Not reacting to the lies, I don't know the chemistry But I know that everything will happen how it's meant to be From a small town, tryna make it out to better living No reminiscing on memories of shit I was missing No politician, but they listen to the shit that I say On my way to better days I never seen a delay I been highly debated, I'm never jaded to the life Not degraded by haters who busy wasting all their time I been murderding beats and now they be calling it a crime Working while the sun down waiting for my time to shine Now they say I'm rapping 'bout the same thing every time But I'm always seeing people with their focus outta line I been sending the message until they get it, tryna let 'em know Time is too expensive I can't ever let it go  [Chorus] I don't want 'em calling on my phone (on my phone) I been on my way to the top, no ceiling They leaving a message at the tone (at the tone) Tryna get involved, but I really don't need it I don't want 'em calling on my line (on my line) I know what they wanted and it's not no secret I'ma tell 'em that I'm doing fine (doing fine) Tryna get involved, but I really don't need it",

    I just can't stop thinking about her
    I don't know, all I remember was she wear the Skechers
    The light-up ones
    Shawty bad with the Skechers on
    Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl

    We tryna quarantine, she won't leave me alone
    I got Yeezys, you got them Skechers on (haha)
    Kicks like a hypebeast, but I don't wait in line
    You got the moves when you move, when you whine
    You can call me up, let it ring one time (brrt)
    1-800-Big-Vibe bling my hotline (brrt)
    I don't want to share you
    Only want to wear you
    Ooh, I think I like you
    Skate and slide beside you (Bible)
    I ball like Kyle Kuzma, I'm runnin' it up
    She a stallion like Meg when she liftin' it up
    Can I get two of you for the price of one-one?
    Shawty bad with the Skechers on
    Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl

    Light up, light up my world (light it up)

    I like your Skechers, you like me, my Gucci shoes
    I'll buy you the purse, only if you show me your boobs
    I like your Skechers, you like me too
    Bring your friends, all of us in the pool
    Bad lil' bitch, all my drip make her drool
    Brand new whip, come and sit in the coupe
    I just wanna make you mine, hop inside the ride
    Nina by my side, promise you it all be fine
    I-I just wanna make you mine, hop inside the ride
    Nina by my side, promise it's gon' be alright

    Lyrics: `I always knew that you would break my heart
    From the start I knew I should've never gave my heart
    Friends told me blood told me should've played it smart
    And all them times we broke it off we better if we stayed apart, yeah
    Shoulda listened I was young and dumb
    It's kinda crazy all the things that you would do for love
    Lied to myself for a while now the truth has come
    I'm glad to hear you movin' on, baby girl
    I'm movin' up
    Held me back, we held each other back
    The bad times were like a cycle, but the good I fell in love with that
    I always wanted to be stuck with that
    But you just left my life when it's convenient for you
    Then come running back, fuck that
    I'm done with that
    I don't got the time for it
    I just wanted you, and you just try to make me drown for it
    After all the pain you caused I always held it down for you
    Couldn't do the same, so tell me who's the one to blame, huh
    When the nightfalls and the lights off
    All alone it's no one I call
    Around them white walls
    I just drown in my thoughts
    Over again
    I'm so lost
    When the nightfalls and the lights off
    All alone it's no one I call
    Around them white walls
    I just drown in my thoughts
    Over again
    I'm so lost
    Cross my heart and hope to live
    Realized I don't wanna die
    Since 2016, when we lost homie
    On a drunken drive
    He warned me bout the demons that will lurk into your life
    Through the shadows of your dreams and suck you up then leave you dry
    He told me from the heavens but I didn't listen
    Went against my intuition built the frame work of a vision
    That just wasn't realistic, I was broken to you
    Deep incisions from the scars that I reopened they're new
    I always told you but you didn't get it, so my attention was on mute
    When it's all about you, and it's not about me, girl it's was all about us
    But I could never trust you, so I don't know what
    What the fuck that you want? I got none left to give
    Whether dawn or it's dusk
    I just give and I give and it turned into what?
    It's turned into what
    It turned into nothing, just emptiness
    Stare at my wall, thinking maybe I'm done
    When the nightfalls and the lights off
    All alone it's no one I call
    Around them white walls
    I just drown in my thoughts
    Over again
    I'm so lost
    When the nightfalls and the lights off
    All alone it's no one I call
    Around them white walls
    I just drown in my thoughts
    Over again
    I'm so lost`,

    Hit the bong, hit the bong, feel good
    Feeling shitty in my bed, didn't take my fuckin' meds
    Hyperpop up in my ears, everything just disappears
    Don't wanna be someone else, just don't wanna hate myself
    I just don't wanna hate myself, instead I wanna feel good
    I'm on a sugar crash, I ain't got no fuckin' cash

    Where to now?
    Got the rest of my life just laid out
    Got the rest of my life to fuck around
    Got the rest of my life to make sound
    Feel good`,

          How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? (Oh)
          How you pull up? I pull up (Seth in the kitchen)
          Let's go
          Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
          With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (yeah, yeah, yeah)
          Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar?
          This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (woo)
          My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (woo)
          You better let me go the day you need me (woo)
          Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (woo)
          And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
          It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (yeah, yeah)
          I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
          Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay, " don't make me push the button
          Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
          Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
          I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
          I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
          Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime
          Just to check up on me and my brother
          I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son
          Was always guaranteed to get the money (okay, let's go)
          She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
          She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (boom)
          PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
          My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
          And I'll kill another nigga too
          'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
          Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
          Daddy love you (yeah, yeah)

          And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
          Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
          'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
          I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
          And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
          Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
          My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
          We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
          You fool me one time, you can't cross me again
          Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
          If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
          Maybach SUV for my refugees
          Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
          I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
          Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
          But they ain't even want no smoke (no smoke)
          If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
          Let's go

        Always make sense to you right now
        But hey, what daddy always tell you?
        Straighten up little soldier
        Stiffen up that upper lip
        What you crying about?
        You got me
        Hailie, I know you miss your mom
        And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
        But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
        I can see you're sad
        Even when you smile
        Even when you laugh
        I can see it in your eyes
        Deep inside, you wanna cry
        'Cause you're scared
        I ain't there?
        Daddy's with you in your prayers
        No more crying
        Wipe them tears
        Daddy's here
        No more nightmares
        We gonna pull together through it
        We gon' do it
        Lainie, uncle's crazy ain't he?
        Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
        We're all we got in this world
        When it spins
        When it swirls
        When it whirls
        When it twirls
        Two little beautiful girls
        Looking puzzled, in a daze
        I know it's confusing you
        Daddy's always on the move
        Mama's always on the news
        I try to keep you sheltered from it
        But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
        The more it backfires on me
        All the things, growing up
        As daddy that he had to see
        Daddy don't want you to see
        But you see just as much as he did
        We did not plan it to be this way
        Your mother and me
        But things have got so bad between us
        I don't see us ever being together ever again
        Like we used to be when was teenagers
        But then of course
        Everything always happens for a reason
        I guess it was never meant to be
        But it's just something
        We have no control over
        And that's what destiny is
        But no more worries
        Rest your head and go to sleep
        Maybe one day we'll wake up
        And this will all just be a dream
        Now hush little baby don't you cry
        Everything's gonna be alright
        Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
        I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya
        Through the night
        I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
        We fear how we feel inside
        It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
        But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright
        It's funny
        I remember back one year when daddy had no money
        Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
        And stuck 'em under the tree
        And said some of them were from me
        'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
        I'll never forget that Christmas
        I sat up the whole night cryin'
        'Cause daddy felt like a bum
        See daddy had a job

        But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
        And at the time, every house that we lived in
        Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
        And your mom, was saving money
        For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you
        So you can go to college
        Almost had a thousand dollars
        'Til someone broke in and stole it
        And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart
        And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
        Mom and dad was arguing a lot
        So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat
        One bedroom apartment
        And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra
        And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
        And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me
        But daddy had to work
        You and mama had to leave me
        Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
        And mama didn't like it
        And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
        Papa was a rolling stone
        Mama developed a habit
        And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
        I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
        'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
        Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin'
        Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out
        To see how much you both have grown
        It's almost like your sisters now
        Wow, I guess you pretty much are
        And daddy's still here
        Lainie I'm talking to you too
        Daddy's still here
        I like the sound of that, yeah
        It's got a ring to it, don't it?
        Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment
        Now hush little baby don't you cry
        Everything's gonna be alright
        Stiffen that upper lip up little lady
        I told ya daddy's here to hold ya
        Through the night
        I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
        We fear how we feel inside
        It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
        But I promise

        Mama's gonna be alright
        And if you ask me to
        Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
        I'ma give you the world
        I'ma buy a diamond ring for you
        I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
        And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
        I'ma break that birdy's neck
        I'll go back to the jeweller who sold it to ya
        And make him eat every carat
        Don't fuck with dad, haha`,

    Lyrics: `[Intro: Dan Reynolds]
        Look out for yourself
        
        [Verse 1: Dan Reynolds]
        I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
        For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
        I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
        When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
        Tell you you're the greatest
        But once you turn, they hate us
        
        [Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
        Oh, the misery
        Everybody wants to be my enemy
        Spare the sympathy
        Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
        (Look out for yourself)
        My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
        (Look out for yourself)
        But I'm ready
        
        [Verse 2: Dan Reynolds]
        Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
        And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
        I stack it in my mind, and I'm waiting for the time
        When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
        
        
        [Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
        Tell you you're the greatest
        But once you turn, they hate us (Ha)
        
        [Chorus: Dan Reynolds & JID]
        Oh, the misery
        Everybody wants to be my enemy
        Spare the sympathy
        Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look)
        (Look out for yourself)
        My enemy-y-y-y-y (Look, look, look, look; yeah)
        (Look out for yourself)
        Uh, look, okay
        
        [Verse 3: JID]
        I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
        I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
        I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
        Being a wreck of emotions
        Ready to go whenever, just let me know
        The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
        The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
        I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
        They wanna plot on my trot to the top
        I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
        I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
        And it matters more because I had it not
        Had I thought about wreaking havoc
        On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
        With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
        I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
        Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
        Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat
        [Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
        Everybody wants to be my enemy
        Spare the sympathy (Ah)
        Everybody wants to be my enemy
        Oh, the misery (Ah)
        Everybody wants to be my enemy
        Spare the sympathy (Ah)
        Everybody wants to be my enemy
        
        [Outro: Dan Reynolds]
        Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way
        My enemy
        Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint
        (Look out for yourself)`,
